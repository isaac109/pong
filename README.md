About Pong: This project was created to get a better grasp about network communications. Utilizing tcp protocols, two players can establish a connection, and play the classic game of Pong. The network communications were written in C++ and the graphics were written in OpenGl using the GLUT library. Players will have the ability to play until a score of 10 is achieved, at which point the game will declare a winner.
Known Issues:
  If an entity containing a paddle (the client's player 2 paddle or the server's player 1 paddle) attempt to move the paddle to block the     ball at the last possible moment, that entity will recognize a block. However, due to the delay in communication between the server      and the client, the opposing entity will not recognize a block. This will cause both entities to play out in their own scenarios.
  For an unkown and so far a nonrecreatable reason, the instances will stop communicating with eachother. This will cause the game to        only update when input exists, either by key press or moving the game screen.
